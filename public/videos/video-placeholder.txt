This directory should contain optimized versions of the video files for production.

The original video files are likely too large for efficient deployment.
Consider compressing the videos with a tool like HandBrake or FFmpeg before deployment.

Recommended sizes:
- working-out.mp4: Aim for 5-10MB max (currently 59MB)
- Meal-Plan.mp4: Aim for 3-5MB max (currently 21MB)

These videos should be compressed and placed in this directory.
